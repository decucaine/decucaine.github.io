			The Pacifican Republic of Decu Caine is a huge, socially progressive nation, renowned for its museums and concert halls, keen interest in outer space, and daily referendums. The compassionate, hard-working, democratic, devout population of 685 million Cainites hold their civil and political rights very dear, although the wealthy and those in business tend to be viewed with suspicion.

			The relatively small, liberal, outspoken government juggles the competing demands of Education, Healthcare, and Administration. It meets to discuss matters of state in the capital city of Dohs Pi'cos. Citizens pay a flat income tax of 22.5%.
